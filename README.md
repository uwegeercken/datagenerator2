# datagenerator2

The datagenerator tool is currently (July '23) under development. Additional features and capabilities will be added over time.

The datagenerator tool allows to generate random data. The aim is to have a tool that generates data in a way which is flexible enough to satisfy the needs of developers or analysts or anybody else who needs some sort
of test data - possibly with dependencies between individual fields and variying/definable distribution of fieldConfiguration values. 

The tool requires a yaml file which contains configuration details for the tool itself, including attributes for the
export of the generated data to files. A second yaml file defines how the data is generated in terms of fields, field weight and
other attributes.
Some of the configuration attributes may also be passed as arguments when running the datagenerator tool. In this case these
will override the same attributes from the configuration files.

## Features
- select random values from word lists
- generate random strings, long or double
- generate random dates (to be implemented)
- generate random data according to a given regular expression (to be implemented)
- transform the generated data values: uppercase, lowercase, base64 encode, negate, round, encrypt and more
- export rows of generated data in CSV, Excel or Json
- export rows of generated data in Parquet format (to be implemented)

## Types of generators
Different types of generators are available to generate different type of data such as strings, numbers, dates, etc.

For each field specified in the yaml configuration file one of the generators has to be defined.

### Random Strings
This type of generator generates purely random text. The options in the yaml configuration file allow to specify the range of characters to be used for constructing the random text. Additional options allow to specify the minimum and maximum length.
Setting minLength=maxLength will create a constant length string.

#### Available options:
| Option           | Description                                     | Data Type   | Default                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| minLength        | minimum length of the value                     | long        | 0                            |
| maxLength        | maximum length of the value                     | long        | 40                           |
| randomCharacters | characters to be used when generating the value | String      | [a-z] + [A-Z] + [0-9] + [-_] |

#### Available transformations:
| Transformation | Description                            | Parameters |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|------------|
| uppercase      | convert the value to uppercase         | none       |
| lowercase      | convert the value to lowercase         | none       |
| reverse        | reverse the characters of the value    | none       |
| base64encode   | encode the value to base64 format      | none       |

### Random Numbers
This generator allows to generate numbers. The options for this type of generator allow to specify a lowerbound and upperbound for the generated value.

#### Available options:
| Option     | Description    | Data Type    | Default   |
|------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| minValue   | minimum value  | long         | 0         |
| maxValue   | maximum value  | long         | 1000000   |

### Random Floating Point Numbers
This generator allows to generate floating point numbers. The options for this type of generator allow to specify a lowerbound and upperbound for the generated value.

#### Available options:
| Option     | Description    | Data Type    | Default   |
|------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| minValue   | minimum value  | long         | 0         |
| maxValue   | maximum value  | long         | 1000000   |

#### Available transformations:
| Transformation | Description                                 | Parameters                         |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| round          | round the value using rounding mode HALF_UP | number of decimal places (integer) |

### Word lists
Word lists allow to define values for certain categories such as "weekdays", "seasons", "car types",
"first names", etc. the generator will randomly pick a value from the configured word lists. Word lists are simple text files where each row contains one value.
As such all values of the word lists are treated as strings (even if you have a word list containing e.g numbers).

Using word lists offers a few advantages:
- word lists can be stored in a directory hierarchy where e.g. different directories defined the same word lists but in different languages or the structure deinfes word lists for different environments (test/production)
- word lists can be created from a data extract from a database, such as a select distinct on a certain column
- word lists can be constructed from a script processing a data file or consuming a Rest API
- word lists can be constructed or changed easily using a simple text editor

In the yaml configuration additional values for a given word list (also value which are already defined in the word list itself) may be defined, including a weight for individual values.
This allows to specify a higher priority/weight for defined values. The weight of a value is always specified on the base of 100 percent. 

E.g. one may define the days of the week in a word list and in the configuration file "Saturday" with a weight of 10 percent and 
"Sunday" with a weight of 10 percent. The other days "Monday" to "Friday" will then be assigned a weight of 16 percent so that the overall sum of percentages is 100 %.

If a value for a given word list appears both in the word list file and the yaml configuration file, the setting from the configuration will overrule the value from the word list file.

The datagenerator will then produce random data (pick random values from the word list) according to the weights assigned. In the example above "saturday" and "sunday" will occur
less often in the generated number of rows then the other days, because these values have a lower weight.

A word list is optional. All values to be used for randomly generating data can also be defined solely in the yaml configuration file. Anyways, the sum of the weight definition
must be 100 percent (and can not exceed 100 percent). Individual values can not be negative percentage values.

**NOTE**: If values and their weight are specified in a word lists but for some values no weight is defined, the datagenerator will calculate the weight for those fields that have no weight definition
and equally distribute the weight value. But, depending on the number of values without a weight definition , it might not be possible to exactly evenly distribute the value. In this case some values
from the word list might get a slightly higher weight value. If weight definitions are assigned in a way that the remaining percentage for the other values is less than 1 percent an error occurs. 

#### Available options:
| Option | Description | Data Type   | Default       |
|--------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
|        |             |             |               |

#### Available transformations:
| Transformation | Description                                            | Parameters                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| uppercase      | convert the value to uppercase                         | none                      |
| lowercase      | convert the value to lowercase                         | none                      |
| reverse        | reverse the characters of the value                    | none                      |            
| prepend        | add a prefix to the value                              | prefix to add (String)    | 
| append         | add a suffix to the value                              | suffix to add (String)    |
| base64encode   | encode the value to base64 format                      | none                      |

## Processing steps
First, the given yaml configuration file and the datagenerator yaml file are analyzed for its correctness. Basically the specified options and transformations are checked for correctness.

Any table definitions and data is removed from the DuckDb, if a file with the specified name is found.

After that the value for each field is generated and then transformed (if any transformation options are specified). The fields are processed sequentially and build a row of data.
The tool generates the desired number of rows and stores it in a local DuckDb instance. The data types specified in the yaml configuration are used to defined the data types of the duckdb table which is created.

Finally the data is exported to the desired output format.

## Yaml configuration for the datagenerator tool
The configuration file contains various attributes to steer the behavior of the datagenerator tool.

Sample program configuration:

    exportFilename: /tmp/csv_export.json
    exportType: json
    numberOfRowsToGenerate: 5000
    generatedRowsLogInterval: 1000
    csvExport:
      delimiter: comma
      includeHeader: true
    jsonExport:
      asArray: true
    excelExport:
      format: gdal
      driver: xlsx
    parquetExport:
      compression: gzip
      partitionBy: gender


- the name of the export file for the generated data
- the type of the export file: csv, excel or json
- the number of rows to generate
- after how many generated rows a log message shall be output
- details for the export to a csv file - delimiter and header settings
- details for the export to a json file - output as separate lines or as array
- details for the export to a parquet file or partitioned file
- details for the export to an excel file

## Yaml configuration for the definition of fields to generate
The configuration file contains a list of fields/attributes to generate - see the sample yaml files in this repository under: src/main/resources/config. Besides this definition it contains other configurable settings of the datagenerator tool.

Sample fields configuration:

    name: Sample 1

## Running the datagenerator tool
To run the tool you must pass at least two arguments to the program as shown below. These point to the program configuration file
and the data configuration file. There are additional arguments available which can be used to override the values specified in the
configuration yaml files.

Run the datagenerator tool:

    java -cp . com.datamelt.utilities.datagenerator.DataGenerator -pc=<program configuration file> -dc=<data configuration file>

You can get help about the available program arguments by running:

    java -cp . com.datamelt.utilities.datagenerator.DataGenerator --help

See the sample yaml file for the program configuration in this repository under: src/main/resources/config.
